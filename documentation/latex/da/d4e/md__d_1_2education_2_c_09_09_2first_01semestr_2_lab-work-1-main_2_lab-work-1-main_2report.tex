Update the solution for Lab Work 1 (image processing from the first semester) by adding parallelism to the implementation. Note that rewriting the code from scratch is not considered a solution.

Conduct a reproducible experiment that justifies that the new solution works faster than the old one, and write a report on it.\hypertarget{md__d_1_2education_2_c_09_09_2first_01semestr_2_lab-work-1-main_2_lab-work-1-main_2report_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Experiment Results}{Experiment Results}}\label{md__d_1_2education_2_c_09_09_2first_01semestr_2_lab-work-1-main_2_lab-work-1-main_2report_autotoc_md8}

The experiment clearly shows a significant performance improvement when using parallel processing methods compared to sequential methods. The parallel execution time (0.\+0758145 seconds) is substantially lower than the sequential execution time (0.\+553313 seconds) for the given image processing tasks (rotation and Gaussian filtering) on the {\ttfamily sample1.\+bmp} image.

This speedup is achieved by leveraging multiple processor cores to perform computations concurrently, as implemented using Open\+MP in the C++ code. The parallel versions of {\ttfamily rotate90\+Clockwise}, {\ttfamily rotate90\+Cont\+Clockwise}, and {\ttfamily apply\+Gaussian\+Filter} distribute the workload across available threads, leading to a faster overall execution time.\hypertarget{md__d_1_2education_2_c_09_09_2first_01semestr_2_lab-work-1-main_2_lab-work-1-main_2report_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Conclusion}{Conclusion}}\label{md__d_1_2education_2_c_09_09_2first_01semestr_2_lab-work-1-main_2_lab-work-1-main_2report_autotoc_md10}
The addition of parallelism to the image processing solution has successfully resulted in a more performant application. The experimental results validate that the parallel implementation is significantly faster than the original sequential version, fulfilling the requirements of the task.
